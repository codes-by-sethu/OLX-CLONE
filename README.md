# OLX-CLONE
🚀 OLX CLONE: Next-Generation C2C Marketplace PlatformThis project defines a scalable, secure, and feature-rich Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) marketplace platform, developed as a core system deliverable for the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science1. It directly addresses critical vulnerabilities and feature gaps identified in legacy classifieds models, particularly concerning user fraud and ad lifecycle management2222.💡 Core Innovation & Value PropositionThe OLX CLONE introduces a layer of proactive governance and seller autonomy that elevates it beyond existing platforms3.Robust Trust & Safety Framework: Implements mechanisms for immediate customer reporting and blocking of fraudulent users444444444.Ad Lifecycle Management (ALM): Provides sellers with granular control to shift product ads between Active and Inactive states as needed, a capability lacking in the original system5555.Data Integrity Enforcement: Allows for the administrative blocking/unblocking of products based on "fakeness" or policy violations, ensuring a cleaner marketplace inventory6.🛠️ Technology Stack Deep DiveThe architecture leverages a proven, high-performance open-source stack, ensuring rapid development, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.LayerComponentTechnical Edge / RationaleFront-End/ApplicationPython 7Chosen for its high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting capabilities, enabling fast iteration and highly readable, maintainable code888888888. Supports a broad standard library for rapid feature implementation9999.Back-End/Data PersistenceMySQL 10Selected as a freely available RDBMS 11providing high performance and ultimate scalability12121212. Its storage engine architecture is configurable for demanding transactional processing and high-volume web services13.Data Integrity ModelNormalization 14Database schema adheres to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to eliminate data redundancy, maintain integrity, and build a flexible, adaptable data structure15151515.Operating EnvironmentWindows 10 16The base operating system for the development and deployment environment.⚙️ System Architecture & ModularityThe system is compartmentalized into distinct, decoupled modules to facilitate development and maintenance17:1. Administrator (Gov. Module) 18This module functions as the central control plane, responsible for platform integrity and content curation:User/Customer Management: Block/unblock customers19.Content Moderation: Block/unblock products, view sold ads20.Catalog Taxonomy: Manage (add/configure) product categories21.2. Customer (Client/User Module) 22This module supports the full user journey from registration to transaction and engagement:Secure Access: Registration, Login, and Profile Management23.Commerce & Listing: Submit ads (submit_ad table), edit/delete listings, and change product status to sold manually24.Engagement & Retention: Add ads to favorites (favourites table), and utilize the built-in communication feature (chat_groups, messages tables)25.Feedback Loop: Report other customers (reports table)26.🛡️ Quality Assurance LifecycleQuality assurance was paramount, employing a systematic testing regime to ensure functionality and data flow integrity27.Unit Testing: Isolates and tests individual modules to detect coding and logic errors28.Integration Testing: Verifies smooth data transition and function between interconnected modules (e.g., Admin and Customer functionalities)29.Validation Testing: Confirms the fully assembled software package meets initial specifications and requirements30.User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The final black-box testing step to ensure end-user confidence and satisfaction31.
